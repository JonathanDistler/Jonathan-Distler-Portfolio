# Mechanical Design Class Project (MAE 2250)

As part of a class project for **Mechanical Design (MAE 2250)**, I was tasked with drawing and then developing an accurate CAD model for a household object. I chose the **Seiko SRPG 41**.

As part of a class project for Mechanical Design (MAE 2250). I was tasked with drawing and then developing an accurate CAD model for a household object. I chose the Seiko SRPG 41. 

My initial process involved dimensioning each component of the watch, from the circumference and diameter of the face to the depth of the dial. Then, I developed unique "parts" for each system, involving core geometries and time-saving processes (i.e., mirroring). 

Then, I combined all of the unique "parts" together into one functional CAD model. Finally, I added "joints" that helped define the real-world physics of the watch. I tried to approach this design with an idea of how the components interacted with each other in my watch. Everything was based around the watch face: the hands, the watch straps, and the tuner all interacted with the watch face.

I started by building the watch face in its own sketch and then combining all of the other components in an assembly. I tried to build each object very basically, and then, after putting it into the assembly, I would add more details in its individual sketch.

I think that in the future I would do a similar strategy, but I would try to build all of the pieces individually before putting them together in the assembly, rather than going one by one because a lot of my time was spent working on joints when I feel that it wouldn’t have interrupted my workflow building each piece before combining.

I had the most trouble with the angular design of the watch bands. I tried to constrain both sides individually, but I ended up finding it easier to fully constrain one side and then mirror across the center of the strap. 

I also found it time-consuming to make each individual hole in the watch band. I couldn’t figure out an easy way to do a repeated task like that, but I hope to find a solution in the future.
