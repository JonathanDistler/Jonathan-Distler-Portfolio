# Project Overview

For this project, our group was tasked with developing an object to address the needs of a specific group of people. After conducting interviews, we identified a market need for space-saving gym equipment that can be utilized in small living spaces.

**Project Statement:**  
*"We will design a piece of space-saving equipment for people with limited space throughout their day-to-day lives, enabling them to exercise and optimize their space."*

## Design Components

The main components of our design included the boards for the backrest and seat. Given that we only had access to ¼” thick sheets of plywood, we decided to glue two sheets together to enhance structural integrity and support intended weights. This required wood glue.

Another critical feature was the foldable backstand, made from a long steel rod. Since steel rods were not available at the precise 16” length required to align the seat flush with the backrest, we milled the bar to the correct size. The backstand also required a holder for secure placement when not in use. To address this, we designed a CAD holder and sent it to the RPL for 3D printing.

**Budget:**  
Our prototype budget combined "real" and "Cornell" funds, with $300 allotted for both categories. The final prototype cost amounted to $259.09.

## Chair Success

The chair's primary objective was to support the combined weight of a human and their lifting equipment. It successfully allowed users to sit without tipping over. Additionally, it unfolded from a seated position into a prone position, suitable for bench-pressing, within approximately 20 seconds. The chair remained stable when fully unfolded.

## Reflection

### Successes:
- The part-ordering and assembly processes went smoothly, enabling the creation of a functional prototype that fulfilled several intended functions.
- Group members successfully tested the chair's base, confirming its durability.
- Scaling the model directly from a 1:4 ratio to a full-scale 1:1 without intermediate steps worked out efficiently—an uncommon but successful approach.

### Challenges:
- The design process overlooked fastener specifications, leading to ad-hoc decisions during assembly. We plan to standardize fastener sizes (e.g., M5) in future iterations to improve stability and structural rigidity.
- The plywood's craft-grade quality limited structural integrity, causing screws to break during stress testing.
- Connecting the support rod to its base disk posed challenges due to a lack of appropriate tools (e.g., welding equipment). Future designs could use aluminum for the backrest, as it is easier to fasten, cheaper, and lighter than steel.

### Adjustments:
- Repurposed the unattached base disk as a counterweight for the chair's base.
- Used one of the extra legs to reinforce the reactions on the backrest, compensating for instability issues.
- Addressed the lack of rigidity in the backrest by adding small plywood planks to hold pieces together, supplementing the steel brackets.
- Since we couldn’t connect the hinge to the steel rod as intended, we used glue and duct tape to bind them. This may not provide great structural stability but kept the pieces together, meeting part of our design goals.

### Future Improvements:
Most of the issues we encountered stemmed from the rapid scaling of the model from a 1:4 to a 1:1 ratio. Future iterations should account for factors such as the weight of the backrest affecting the chair's stability. Improvements in the design phase will likely reduce the challenges faced during assembly.
