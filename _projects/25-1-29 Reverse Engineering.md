# Design Project: Product Reverse Engineering

For this project, I was tasked with taking apart a household object, sketching the object, and then explaining the design components of the object, as well as whether or not I thought it was well-designed.

## Product Choice: Speaker Stand

I chose a speaker stand for my product. Through the teardown process, I discovered that the functionality comes down to two main components:
1. **Rigid Links**: These keep the legs at the same angle from each other, improving stability during the raising or lowering of the larger tube.
2. **Connector Piece**: This can be loosened, allowing the smaller tube to telescope into the larger tube for adjustable heights.

## Evaluation of Design

### Strengths
The product accomplishes its main goals as a speaker stand:
- **Adjustable and Linked Legs**: Provide stability for heavy speakers held in varying positions.
- **Telescoping Tubes**: Allow different height adjustments for audio setups, providing versatility.
- **Compact Design**: The stand measures roughly 4 feet long with a 1-foot circumference, making it transportable and easy to set up.

The links between the legs are strong enough to keep the legs at equal angles apart from each other. If the legs were at different angles, the center of mass of the system would shift off-center, compromising stability.

The telescoping tubes are a simple yet effective feature, enabling easy height manipulation while minimizing complexity and weight.

### Weaknesses
Some aspects of the stand may be over-designed:
- **Stability Key and Connector Redundancy**: The inclusion of both seems unnecessary. The stability key prevents the smaller tube from sliding through the connector during height adjustments via evenly spaced holes. However, these holes are spaced far apart (roughly 4 inches), reducing accuracy in height placement.

## Conclusion
Overall, I consider this a well-designed product with one key over-designed aspect. The stand’s compactness, stability, and adjustable height make it a valuable tool for consumers needing versatile audio setups, despite the redundancy in its stability features.
