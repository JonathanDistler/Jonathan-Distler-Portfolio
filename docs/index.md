My name is Jonathan Distler, and I am a rising Junior studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University, with an emphasis on physics and simulation. I am interested in robotics (especially soft-robotics), aerospace, entrepreneurship, and public policy. I am currently working on the Cornell Hyperloop Project team, developing novel structures to maintain the structural integrity of the Hyperloop. I am also conducting research in Dr. Gregory Falco's Adversary Lab, developing an indoor GPS system to accurately query the position of drones. 

Take a look at [my projects]({{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}) and [my CV]({{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}).
