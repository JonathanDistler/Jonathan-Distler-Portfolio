    <h5 class="card-title text-primary">Overview</h5>
    <p>I contributed to a cross-disciplinary research initiative aimed at developing a conceptual framework for utilizing drones to deliver food to rural, food-insecure communities. This collaboration involved faculty from Virginia Tech specializing in nutrition and mechanical engineering.</p>
    <h5 class="card-title text-primary mt-4">Conference Presentation</h5>
    <p>The resulting paper underwent peer review and was presented at the <strong>IEEE Mipro Conference</strong> held in Opatija, Croatia.</p>
    <h6 class="mt-3">Research Areas</h6>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Drone Regulations</strong>: Addressing compliance with local and international drone laws.</li>
      <li><strong>Dietary Restrictions</strong>: Understanding community-specific dietary needs.</li>
      <li><strong>Nutritional Supplements</strong>: Identifying essential nutrients to be included in deliveries.</li>
      <li><strong>Engineering Education</strong>: Exploring how drone technology integrates with curricula in schools and universities.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 class="card-title text-primary mt-4">Published Research</h5>
    <p>The research was documented in a paper, accessible here:<br>
