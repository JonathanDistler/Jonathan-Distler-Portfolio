## Objective

# Aspiring Engineering Student

Aspiring engineering student with a strong foundation in computation and design, driven by a passion for robotics, aerospace, entrepreneurship, and public policy. My journey has been shaped by hands-on experience in the Biomechanics Lab at Virginia Tech, where I delved into innovative soft-robotics research under the mentorship of Dr. Noel Naughton. I further advanced my expertise working in the Aerospace Adversary Lab at Cornell, under Dr. Gregory Falco, where I contributed to cutting-edge research in aerospace systems and cybersecurity protocols ([Aerospace Adversary Lab](https://aerospaceadversary.org/)).

Currently, I am a member of the Cornell University Hyperloop team on the Structures Subteam, where I contribute to designing and optimizing the structural components of cutting-edge Hyperloop technology ([Cornell Hyperloop](https://www.cornellhyperloop.com/)).

Looking ahead, I am thrilled to continue exploring the forefront of engineering as I join Dr. Robert Katzschmann's Soft-Robotics Lab at ETH Zurich ([Soft Robotics Lab](https://srl.ethz.ch/)). I aim to contribute meaningfully to advancing technology that shapes our future.
